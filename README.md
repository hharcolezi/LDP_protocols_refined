# Revisiting and Re-Optimizing LDP Protocols
This repository contains the implementation of the experiments and methodologies presented in the paper **"Revisiting Locally Differentially Private Protocols: Towards Better Trade-offs in Privacy, Utility, and Attack Resistance"**. 
The key contributions of this project include:
- Introducing adaptive versions of existing protocols: ASS, AUE, ALH, and ATHE.
- Proposing a two-objective optimization framework to minimize Attacker Success Rate (ASR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Analytical and empirical evaluation of protocols across different settings.

The repository provides all the code necessary to reproduce the experiments and results from the paper.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have Python installed (version >= 3.8). Install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1 - Explore the Experiments: Navigate to the experiments Jupyter notebook ``LDP_MSE_ASR.ipynb`` to review and execute the experiments.

2 - Run Custom Protocols: The ``ldp_protocols`` folder contains modular implementations of the LDP protocols. Import them into your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks as needed. For example:

```python
from ldp_protocols.aue import AdaptiveUnaryEncoding

k = 10  # Domain size
epsilon = 4  # Privacy budget
input_data = 3  # User's true value

# Test Adaptive Unary Encoding
aue = AdaptiveUnaryEncoding(k, epsilon, w_asr=0.5, w_variance=0.5)
print("AUE Obfuscate:", aue.obfuscate(input_data))
print("AUE ASR:", aue.get_asr())
print("AUE Variance:", aue.get_variance(), "\n")

```

3 - Reproduce Figures: Figures used in the paper can be generated by running the notebook. Results will be saved in the results folder.
